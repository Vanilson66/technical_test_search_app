# How to run the code?
*make sure that you have the node instaled

- Install yarn:
npm install --global yarn

- Inside the project folder, Install the dependencies running:
yarn install

- Run the code
yarn run dev

# How the code is organized?
The code was organized containing the pages inside the pages folder with 
the local components in the same folder, global components in the 
components folder and also the utils folder containing some tools.

The search works through the URL, so when doing a search you are redirected 
to the results page where the code collects the parameters in the url and 
filters the api data through it.


# What would you have done differently if you had more time? Why?
As it is a research App, there are many possibilities when it comes to scale, so
in a project like this I would plan it thinking about where it would grow, thinking 
this way to create a code with the correct level of abstraction, without it becoming
too abstract to the point of making it difficult to understand or "glued" making 
maintenance difficult.

Now looking at it just as a test, for example, in the research part, you could create a 
"recent history" using the browser's local-storage, further improving responsiveness by 
adapting it to less common devices, such as a smartwatch.
